Knitr, Markdown and Workflow for R Reports
========================================================

Knitr is a tool for creating documents which combine text and code, and the result of executing that code. It's a descendant of Knuth's _Literate Programming_ which is closely related to the R documentation tool chain SWEAVE (R code + processor -> LaTeX -> pdf or html).

Some definitions:

markup: Additional punctuation, for indicating parts of a document. 

markup language: Similar to a human language, it's the collection of conventions for marking up a document. HTML, LaTeX, and markdown are all markup languages. 

markdown: http://www.markdowntutorial.com The language that this document is marked up with. It is a plain text format which is not intrusive to read as a plain text document. (As opposed to a markup language like HTML or XML which is annoying or impossible to read in source.)

reproducible research: a set of conventions and practices for working with computer experiments to enable you to repeat the research in the future, or for someone else to repeat it.

version control: Like backups for your work in progress, or an electronic archive of the various stages of your work. Tools like git, through websites like github, let you save your work as you are creating and modifying it. Like working with a net. 

RStudio: an integrated development environment for R. Can be run on your local computer, or on a remote server and accessed through a browser. Free. Highly recommended. rstudio.org

R: a language and environment for statistical programming. Open Source. Descended from S. The most popular language for statistical programming. New research is written in R.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
